# Book-Review-Analysis
For this project I started by using APIs requests and Helium to scrape data regarding 500 book reviews from the Manhattan Book Review website. I then cleaned and structured this data for analysis. For analysis, I considered the top 10 words with most varied connotation, top 10 words with least varied connotation, top 10 most positive words, top 10 most negative words, a frequency plot regarding the book rating, a frequency plot regarding the word rating, the top 10 best rated publishers and the top 10 worst rated publishers. Afterwards, a bot was created that takes an input of a book rating and it infers the score that will be given.
