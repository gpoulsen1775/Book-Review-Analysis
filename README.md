# Book-Review-Analysis
Using 500 book reviews scraped from the Manhattan Book Review, I constructed sample mean connoation scores for words on a scale of 1 to 5 using attached review scores. A top 10 analysis was done with regards to mean and variance. Connotations were then used to build a score predictor that would compute the mean connotation of a book review based on input words.
